# StockMarketForecasting

In this comparison analysis, ARIMA, KNN, and LSTM will be cross-referenced to determine the most accurate and reliable model to use in stock market forecasting. The focus will primarily be on the claim that LSTM has a tendency to be more exact and error-free than other machine learning models with respect to stock market forecasting. The general objective is to help inform investors about the benefits and drawbacks of using ARIMA, KNN, and LSTM when predicting stock market activity. This will aid investors in maximizing their returns while remaining vigilant of their risk when using these models Another goal is to alert experts to potential issues with these algorithms and generate a conversation surrounding the error reduction methods and aid in innovating forecasting techniques with machine learning applications.
